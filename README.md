# Blog API

A simple Node.js project for building a Blog REST API. This README is beginner-friendly and guides you from setup to first run.

## Description

This repository is a starting point for a Blog API. It includes the basic Node.js project setup (`package.json`) and is ready for you to add routes, controllers, and database code. Use it to learn backend basics or as a foundation for a complete blog platform.

## Features

- Clean Node.js project scaffold 
- Ready for REST API routes 
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Planned (you can add these as you go):
- CRUD for blog posts (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- User authentication (signup/login)
- Comments and likes
- Input validation and error handling

## Installation & Usage

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (LTS recommended) and npm installed
- Git installed (optional but recommended)

1) Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Ikechukwu-Okwuchukwu-Amaechina/blog-api.git
cd blog-api
```

2) Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

3) Run the app

Right now this project is a scaffold. You have two simple options to run code:

- If you already have an `index.js`, you can run:

```powershell
node index.js
```



```powershell
npm start
```

Tip: If you donâ€™t have an `index.js` yet, create one and start with something small (for example, a basic HTTP server) and iterate from there.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- JavaScript (CommonJS modules)
